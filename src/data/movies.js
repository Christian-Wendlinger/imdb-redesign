        plotSummary: "A heavy-metal drummer's life is thrown into freefall when he begins to lose his hearing. Ruben is a drummer and one half of the metal duo Blackgammon along with the singer, his girlfriend, Lou. They live in a RV while driving across the country to perform gigs. Ruben begins to suddenly lose his hearing. He goes to a pharmacy in order to figure out what is happening to him. The pharmacist refers him to a doctor that Ruben is able to see immediately. The doctor performs a hearing test and determines Ruben can only successfully hear 20-30 percent of words and his hearing will continue to deteriorate rapidly. He may be able to get cochlear implants to correct it.",

The loss of hearing is a sensory device, a part of us, which when lost is overwhelming to deal with and often debilitating to the point of extreme suffering of the mind. The Sound of Metal is a good play on words, because the main character has to deal with the loss of his \"metal\" music, but later that word comes to mean something else which you will need to watch the movie to discover."

It's such a specific story, brilliantly captured and conveyed, yet it's one shared by every human that's lived. The struggle to find meaning in the madness. The peace in the chaos. Hope amidst the bleak monotony of daily life. It also trusts that the viewer has a brain and can pick up on nuance. It's subtle. It's layered. It's patient. It's perfect."

With blond hair it's hard to even place him as a Pakistani playing the role. Ahmed is an intense actor and takes us into the world of a tormented drummer trying to come to terms with losing his hearing not long after overcoming addiction. This new battle takes him into an unfamiliar world where the sound design helps the audience feel what the protagonist must feel. This film selves into experimentation with the auditory experience of cinema. An absolute must-watch."
